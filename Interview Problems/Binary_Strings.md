This problem has been presented many times in DS & Algo coding round.

Please get familiar with how function recursion works. Recursion is the process of calling a function from within itself and I can't stress how many lines of code it can save when understood properly. This characteristic of recursion has made it a "no brainer" for the interviewer to choose a problem that would require recursion to solve.


PROBLEM
Given a string containing ‘0’, ‘1’ and ‘?’ wildcard characters, generate all binary strings that can be formed by replacing each wildcard character with ‘0’ or ‘1’.

Example 1 :
Input str = "1??"
Output: 
        100
        110
        101
        111

Example 2 :
Input str = "1??0?101"
Output: 
        10000101
        10001101
        10100101
        10101101
        11000101
        11001101
        11100101
        11101101
